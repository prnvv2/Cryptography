# Symmetric Key Encryption

Symmetric encryption, also known as symmetric key cryptography or secret-key encryption, is a method of data protection that utilizes a single shared key for both the encryption and decryption processes. This means that the same key is used to convert plaintext (readable data) into ciphertext (encrypted data) and vice versa.

# Cryptography

Cryptography is the practice of securing information by converting the plain text into unreadable format (cipher text) to protect it from unauthorized access. Cryptography is the study and application of mathematical techniques for securing communication and data from adversarial access or tampering. It ensures confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation in digital transmition.

## Basic components of cryptography

- ### Plain text
-  Plain text refers to the original, readable data before encryption or before converting it into unreadable format. It can be any form of data, such as text messages, emails, or files.
  
- ### Cipher text
- Cipher text is the encrypted version of plain text. this text is unreadable and converted into cipher text via applying encryption algorithm to the plain text.
  
- ### Encryption
- Encryption is the process of converting plain text (readable data) into an unreadable format (cipher text) using an algorithm and a key.
  
- ### Decryption
- Decryption is the reverse process of encryption, where the cipher text is converted back into plain text using a key.
